# Icon Analysis - January 6, 2026

## Current Icons in Use:

1. **Portal Icon** (`nil-portal-icon-final.jpeg`): 
   - White/gray background
   - Dark navy "n" letter
   - Blue swoosh/arrow going through it
   - Clean, minimal design

2. **Messenger Icon** (`messenger-icon-final.jpeg`):
   - Blue background with gray corner
   - White speech bubble shape
   - Same dark navy "n" with swoosh inside the bubble
   - Has the chat bubble element that differentiates it

## The Issue:
The icons ARE different - Portal has a plain "n" on white, Messenger has the "n" inside a speech bubble on blue.

However, at small sizes (like on mobile), they look very similar because both feature the same "n" with swoosh design.

## Solution Options:
1. Keep as-is (they ARE different, just similar style)
2. Generate completely unique icons for each app
3. Use the ATHLYNX "A" arrow logo for Portal instead of "n"
