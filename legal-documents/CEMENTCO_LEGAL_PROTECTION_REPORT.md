---

## **SECTION 5: CLIENT BREACH - NOT SOFTMOR**

### **CementCo's Failures:**

1. **Failed to attend scheduled workshop** (November 4-5, 2025)
2. **Failed to proceed with Phase C** despite receiving Phase B deliverables
3. **Made defamatory statements** about Chad A. Dozier and Softmor
4. **Attempted to blame Softmor** for their own financial problems with "Peak"
5. **Demanded refund** for work that was fully delivered

### **Contract Language Protecting Softmor:**

From the Phase B Contract:
> "This Agreement shall commence on the date first written above and shall continue until the completion of Phase B, unless terminated earlier as provided herein. SOFMOR, Inc. requires full payment of Phase B upon commencement of this Agreement."

From the Phase B Deliverables section:
> "Customers own the right to all deliveries from Phase B and are free to ask other vendors on offers if customer is not happy with suggested pricing or timeline."

**THIS MEANS:**
- Softmor delivered the work
- CementCo owns the deliverables
- CementCo can use them with any vendor
- NO REFUND IS OWED

---

## **SECTION 6: CEASE AND DESIST - ALREADY SENT**

**Date Sent:** November 2025

**Key Points:**
1. CementCo made defamatory statements
2. Telly W. falsely claimed Chad "made it worse by pressuring us"
3. CementCo tried to connect Softmor to their "Peak" bankruptcy issues
4. Softmor demanded:
   - Immediate cessation of defamatory statements
   - Written retraction within 5 business days
   - Preservation of all evidence

**Liquidated Damages Warning:**
- Compensatory damages for harm to reputation
- Punitive damages
- Injunctive relief

---

## **SECTION 7: WHY CEMENTCO CANNOT SUE**

### **Legal Defenses:**

**1. FULL PERFORMANCE**
Softmor fully performed all Phase A and Phase B obligations. The 23-page scope document proves complete delivery.

**2. NO BREACH BY SOFTMOR**
There is no evidence of any breach by Softmor. All deliverables were provided on time.

**3. CLIENT BREACH**
CementCo breached by:
- Not attending the workshop
- Not proceeding with Phase C
- Making defamatory statements

**4. PAYMENT RECEIVED = ACCEPTANCE**
CementCo paid for Phase B. Payment constitutes acceptance of the work.

**5. DELIVERABLES OWNED BY CLIENT**
Per contract: "Customers own the right to all deliveries from Phase B." CementCo received and owns the deliverables.

**6. NO REFUND CLAUSE**
The contract contains no refund provision. Payment was due "upon commencement" and work was delivered.

**7. DEFAMATION COUNTERCLAIM**
If CementCo sues, Softmor has a strong counterclaim for defamation based on documented false statements.
